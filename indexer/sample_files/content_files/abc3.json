The latest episode in this saga occurred between July 10 and July 12, 2017, when a one-trillion-metric-ton chunk of ice\u2014possibly critical to holding back a large section of the remaining shelf\u2014calved (that is, broke away). </p><!--P1--><p>The Larsen Ice Shelf is located on the eastern side of the <a href=\"/place/Antarctic-Peninsula\">Antarctic Peninsula</a> and juts out into the <a href=\"/place/Weddell-Sea\">Weddell Sea</a>. It originally covered an area of 86,000 square km (33,000 square miles), but its footprint has declined dramatically, possibly as a result of warming air temperatures over the Antarctic Peninsula during the second half of the 20th century. In January 1995 the northern portion (known as Larsen A) disintegrated, and a giant iceberg calved from the middle section (Larsen B). Larsen B steadily retreated until February\u2013March 2002, when it too collapsed and disintegrated. The southern portion (Larsen C) made up two-thirds of the ice shelf\u2019s original extent, covering an area of about 50,000 square km (19,300 square miles) alone. Its thickness ranges from 200 to 600 meters (about 660 to 1,970 feet).&nbsp;Sometime between July 10 and July 12, 2017, a 5,800-square-km- (~2,240-square-mile-) section\u2014some 12% of the Larsen C\u2014broke away. Signs of Larsen C\u2019s impending fracture date back to 2012, when <a href=\"/topic/Earth-satellite\">satellite</a> monitoring detected a steadily growing crack near the Joerg Peninsula at the southern end of the shelf. <a href=\"/topic/NASA\">NASA</a> and <a href=\"/topic/European-Space-Agency\">ESA</a> satellites tracked the rift as it grew to more than 200 km (124 miles) in length and the huge iceberg separated from the continent.&nbsp; </p><div class=\"teadsNative\"></div><p>Although some 88% of Larsen C remains, many scientists worry that it will fall apart like Larsen A and Larsen B, because the loss of such a huge area of the shelf\u2019s ice front may make the remainder of the ice shelf less stable. The shelf\u2019s mass, along with the fact that it is pinned behind shallow undersea outcrops of rock below, creates a natural dam that significantly slows the flow of the ice into the Weddell Sea. Scientists note that the section that calved was not held back by rock, so they are less worried that the loss of the calved section will result in the shelf\u2019s wholesale disintegration in the near term. Some scientists even concede that the calved area could regrow to form a new ice dam that reinforces the shelf. However, the results of ice-calving and glacier-flow <a href=\"/science/mathematical-model\">models</a> predict that the shelf will continue to break apart over the course of years and decades. </p><!--P3--><p>Calving is a natural process driven, in part, by seasonal changes in temperature and the pressures associated with the build-up of compressional stress on the ice.&nbsp;Some studies argue that spring and summer <a href=\"/science/foehn\">foehns</a> (warm dry gusty winds that periodically descend the leeward slopes of mountain ranges) have also contributed to the weakening of the ice.

We have to admit, dead bodies drained of fluids and wrapped in linens can be pretty bone-chilling. However, the process itself is much more than just wrapping up bodies. It involves advanced scientific understanding of human biology and often indicates complex beliefs surrounding the afterlife. Many cultures spanning the globe were practitioners of mummification, and, though it is largely a lost practice, we remain fascinated by the profound scientific knowledge of the peoples who have practiced it.</p><!--P1--><p>The most recognizable method of mummification comes from <a href=\"/place/ancient-Egypt\">ancient Egypt</a>, dating back to 3500 BCE. In this method a metal rod was first pushed through the nasal cavity to the skull. From there, the rod was manipulated in a manner that liquefied the brain tissue, which was then drained through the nose. The rest of the organs were then removed, and the hollow body was cleaned with a mixture of spices and palm wine. The soon-to-be mummy was placed in natron (naturally occurring salt) and left to dry for 40 days. After the flesh was dehydrated, the body was wrapped in layers upon layers of linen, between which priests placed amulets to aid the newly deceased in the afterlife. A top coat of resin was applied to ensure protection from moisture, and then the mummified body was placed in a coffin and sealed in a tomb. The extent of ornamentation, the style of tomb, and the care taken during the mummification process differed on the basis of the recently deceased\u2019s social class.</p><div class=\"teadsNative\"></div><p>You may associate all ancient mummies with the Egyptians, but the earliest evidence of embalming was actually found in the remains of the Chinchorro peoples, who resided in what is now modern-day <a href=\"/place/Chile\">Chile</a>. Unlike the Egyptians, who mummified on the basis of class, the Chinchorro exhibited an egalitarian method of preserving the dead. What\u2019s even more interesting is that though they were mummifying 2,000 years before the Egyptians were, their methods were more advanced. The Chinchorro approach to mummification was lengthy. First a body was relieved of its skin, flesh, organs, and brain. The bones, now exposed, were then taken apart and burnt with hot ash so as to remove any liquid that would allow for decay. They were then reassembled with twigs for support. The newly formed bone-twig skeleton was bound tightly with reeds, and then the skin was reapplied to the body\u2014supplemented with the skin of sea lions or pelicans as required. An ash paste was then painted over the body to ensure stability, and the face was covered in a clay mask. The finishing touch involved either black or ocher paint, which was applied to the entirety of the newly mummified body, most likely for reasons of conformity and equality. </p><!--P3--><p>Oddly enough, you don\u2019t need to die for the process of mummification to begin. Between the 11th and the 19th century, a school of <a href=\"/topic/Buddhism\">Buddhism</a> in <a href=\"/place/Yamagata-prefecture-Japan\">Yamagata</a>, Japan, called <a href=\"/topic/Shingon\">Shingon</a> included members who practiced a method of enlightenment called <em>sokushinbutsu</em>. <em>Sokushinbutsu</em> was, in the simplest of terms, self-mummification. Monks, over a period of 3 to 10 years, followed a diet called <em>mokujikigy\u014d</em>, or \u201ctree eating.\u201d During this thousand-day diet, monks ate only pine needles, nuts, roots, and buds from trees, which rid the body of fat and muscle and delay decomposition after death. After <em>mokujikigy\u014d</em>, monks removed food from their diet completely and drank solely salt water for 100 days, which shrank their organs and further mummified them alive. When a monk felt death approaching, fellow monks would place him in a pine box at the bottom of a pit. The box would be covered in charcoal, with a small bamboo shoot through the top for air. After the monk\u2019s death, the tomb\u2019s airway was removed and the box was sealed. A thousand days later it was reopened and examined for evidence of bodily decay; if any was found, an exorcism was performed and the body was buried again. If not, the mummy would be enshrined. </p><!--P4--><p>There are various other cultures that have practiced mummification outside of the three detailed here, including populations in Africa, Hungary, and Australia, and there are even cultures and individuals that practice it today. While many of us may see mummification as the stuff of horror films, understanding how and why people practiced mummification can help us to further understand our own burial practices and those of cultures which utilized and still utilize mummification today. </p>", "link": "https://www.britannica.com/spotlight/thats-a-wrap-methods-of-mummification", "title": "That\u2019s a Wrap: Methods of Mummification | Britannica.com"}, {"doc_id": "32-abc3", "html": "<p>Humans have colonized nearly every corner of planet <a href=\"/place/Earth\">Earth</a>, and each day more and more land once thought inhospitable or unusable is being utilized for transportation, agriculture, and buildings. By the early 21st century, it seems only the highest <a href=\"/science/mountain-landform\">mountain</a> peaks and the most remote parts of ice caps and <a href=\"/science/desert\">deserts</a> fall into the category of areas not frequently visited by human beings.&nbsp;However, there are two large human-free zones that were made so intentionally\u2014because of serious nuclear accidents. The areas around the sites of the <a href=\"/event/Chernobyl-disaster\">Chernobyl</a> and <a href=\"/event/Fukushima-accident\">Fukushima</a> disasters have been closed off and designated as nuclear exclusion zones because of the ongoing dangers of radiation and its effects.</p><!--P1--><p>The Chernobyl accident occurred on April 25\u201326, 1986, at the nuclear power station in Pryp\u2019yat, Soviet Union (now in Ukraine), some 65 miles (104 km) north of Kiev. Uncooled control rods in a <a href=\"/technology/nuclear-reactor\">reactor</a> core created a chain reaction that blew off the heavy steel and concrete lid of the reactor, which, along with the resulting fire in the graphite reactor core, released large amounts of radioactive material into the atmosphere. Millions of acres of nearby forest and farmland were scorched by radioactive <a href=\"/science/fallout-nuclear-physics\">fallout</a>. The disaster, which released more radiation than the combined load of the atom bombs dropped on <a href=\"/place/Hiroshima-Japan\">Hiroshima</a> and <a href=\"/place/Nagasaki-Japan\">Nagasaki</a>, killed as many as 49 people outright, and dozens of others later developed radiation sickness. More than 300,000 people were eventually evacuated from Pryp\u2019yat and the surrounding area, yet hundreds of thousands more remained in nearby contaminated areas.</p><div class=\"teadsNative\"></div><p>Following the disaster, the <a href=\"/place/Soviet-Union\">Soviet Union</a> placed a circle-shaped exclusion zone with an 18-mile (about 30-km) radius around the plant. The total area of the zone was about 1,017 square miles (2,634 square km), which was later expanded to 1,600 square miles (4,143 square km) to include additional areas that were later found to be heavily radiated. While no people actually live in the exclusion zone, scientists and others can file for permits that allow them to enter for limited amounts of time. Like the <a href=\"/place/demilitarized-zone-Korean-peninsula\">Demilitarized Zone</a> between North Korea and South Korea, the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone has become a <em>de facto</em> biological reserve.&nbsp;Although <a href=\"/science/gamma-ray\">gamma</a> <a href=\"/science/radiation\">radiation</a> can be detected in the area some 1,000 times above the background level, and birth defects and deformities have been detected in local wildlife, some of the area\u2019s flora and fauna have shown a remarkable resilience. Scientists note that the geographic extent of the radiation in the region is patchy, and thus they suggest that many large mobile mammals, such as <a href=\"/animal/wolf\">wolves</a>, <a href=\"/animal/boar-mammal\">boars</a>, <a href=\"/animal/Przewalskis-horse\">Przewalski\u2019s horses</a>, and <a href=\"/animal/fox-mammal\">foxes</a> only receive the occasional high dose of radiation. At least so far, this has not been enough to bring about declines in the populations of these species. In fact, free from human persecution, the populations of these mammals\u2014which were visibly smaller when humans occupied the region\u2014have multiplied. Some ecologists argue that large mammals are attracted to the area, which gives the impression of a naturally rising population, but they believe that ultimately the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone is a population sink, a region that claims more lives than it produces. Other studies note that genetic damage has occurred in many plants and animals within the zone and that some animals, namely certain species of <a href=\"/animal/bird-animal\">birds</a>, have reproductive abnormalities, reduced brain size, and <a href=\"/science/cataract-eye\">cataracts</a>.</p><!--P3--><p>The Fukushima nuclear accident, a disaster which rivaled the magnitude of Chernobyl, began on March 11, 2011, after a <a href=\"/event/Japan-earthquake-and-tsunami-of-2011\">massive offshore earthquake</a> produced a tsunami that washed ashore and damaged the backup generators of the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant, a facility located on the eastern shore of Japan\u2019s <a href=\"/place/Honshu\">Honshu</a> island. The loss of power caused cooling systems to fail in each of the facility\u2019s four reactors. Days later, before power could be restored, the uncooled reactor cores melted through their containment vessels. Several smaller releases of radiation, coupled with explosions in the containment buildings housing three of the facility\u2019s reactors, over the next four days expelled radioactive material from the plant, which contaminated the surrounding countryside. Water used in an attempt to cool the reactors became radioactive in the process and mixed with water from the nearby <a href=\"/place/Pacific-Ocean\">Pacific Ocean</a>.&nbsp;Over the following days, due to concerns about possible radiation exposure, government officials established an 18-mile no-fly zone around the facility, and the land area within a radius of 12.5 miles (20 km) around the plant, covering an area of 230 square miles (600 square km), was evacuated. In a third area that extended to a radius of 30 km around the plant, residents were asked to remain indoors.&nbsp;Ultimately, nearly 165,000 people left their homes and the area.</p><!--P4--><p>As more information about the path of fallout emerged, 80 square miles (207 square km) of land northwest of the initial exclusion zone were also declared dangerous by the Fukushima prefectural government and included in the greater exclusion zone (which increased the total area off-limits to 311.5 square miles [807 square km]). However, starting in August 2015, some areas in the greater exclusion zone that earlier had been declared contaminated were considered safe enough for former residents to either visit their homes and businesses for short periods or return to them permanently. By 2017 the exclusion zone had declined to 143 square miles (371 square km). Despite this seemingly good news, few people have returned so far, most of them elderly. Some studies investigating the effects of the Fukushima nuclear disaster on birds and insects have reported population declines in some species, as well as declines in overall biodiversity among these groups in the exclusion zones.

In 1898 the British agreed to lease Hong Kong from China for 99 years. Beginning in 1982, as the end of the lease loomed, China and the <a href=\"/place/United-Kingdom\">United Kingdom</a> developed a series of accords that would determine the colony\u2019s fate. With the ratification of the Basic Law by Hong Kong\u2019s parliament (which took effect on July 1, 1997), Hong Kong became a Special Administrative Region under the control of the Chinese central government. The plan was that the region would enjoy autonomy under the principle of \u201cone country, two systems,\u201d an idea proposed during the 1980s by Chinese Premier <a href=\"/biography/Deng-Xiaoping\">Deng Xiaoping</a>, and would retain control over its internal matters\u2014that is, its courts, its rule-making and executive government, and its internal security.

Some experts, including officials from mainland China, continue to insist that the \u201cone country, two systems\u201d approach has been successful, arguing that the region\u2019s contrasts with the mainland remain clear.

It appears that dogs, thought to have been the first kind of animal domesticated (from <a href=\"/animal/wolf\">wolves</a>, about 12,000 years ago),  have consistently been selected for a certain set of qualities\u2014among them soft fur, affectionate nature, and tractability\u2014that, as it turns out, mirror qualities exhibited only by wolf puppies. No self-respecting adult wolf would deign to engage in the fawning and begging\u2014or indeed the barking\u2014that have become quintessential of the canine condition. The retention of such characteristics into adulthood is known as neoteny. Neoteny\u2014a phenomenon observed across the biological spectrum, from <a href=\"/plant/cactus\">cacti</a> to <a href=\"/animal/salamander\">salamanders</a> to, some argue, humans\u2014occurs when an organism continues to display juvenile traits even as it sexually matures. While neoteny has occasionally been advantageous in nature\u2014as in the case of certain island birds that have evolved to conserve energy by retaining juvenile wings into adulthood, their insular homes having rendered flight superfluous\u2014toy dogs represent an extreme case. It has been posited that humans possess an innate \u201ccute response\u201d that engenders nurturing feelings toward helpless-looking creatures\u2014a quality advantageous in a species with exceedingly altricial, or undeveloped, offspring. Upon examination, toy dogs seem tailored to superstimulate just that instinct. They are, in essence, <a href=\"/science/fetus\">fetuses</a> ex utero. Their foreshortened limbs and faces, limp ears, and, in some cases, underdeveloped cardiovascular and respiratory systems are all typical of fetal animals.</p><!--P4--><p><strong>Arrested Development</strong></p><!--P5--><p>While it might be one thing if the canine <a href=\"/science/genome\">genome</a> were infinitely plastic and resilient, the reality is that the genetic medium is limited. The shrinking stature of toy dogs comes at a price\u2014one that can be calculated in terms of neoteny. The foreshortened muzzles of such dogs as \u201cteacup\u201d <a href=\"/animal/Chihuahua-dog\">Chihuahuas</a>, <a href=\"/animal/pug\">pugs</a>, and <a href=\"/animal/Japanese-spaniel\">Japanese spaniels (Chins)</a> can lead to dental problems and early tooth loss due to insufficient jaw space. Teacup breeds, the smallest type, which sport enlarged heads, often suffer from open <a href=\"/science/fontanel\">fontanels</a>\u2014which are, as many a nervous parent will know, the membrane-covered spaces between bones of the skull that, in normal development, eventually close as the bones grow together. Because the skulls of these unfortunate dogs have been selected to retain fetal characteristics, they remain unfused throughout the dogs\u2019 life, leaving them at risk of brain damage at the slightest injury. Other breeds, such as the <a href=\"/animal/Cavalier-King-Charles-spaniel\">King Charles spaniel</a>, are at risk of developing brains too large for their skulls entirely. Many toy breeds also suffer from collapsing trachea disorder: because the cartilage in the trachea is not sufficiently developed, the tissue collapses on occasion, momentarily suffocating the dog. The list goes on: weakened hearts, hair in the ear canals (in the case of some toy poodles), spinal deformities in short-legged dogs such as <a href=\"/animal/dachshund\">dachshunds</a>\u2014a veritable freak show of fully avoidable genetic errors.</p><!--P6--><p><strong>Please Curb Your Breeder</strong></p><!--P7--><p>It is possible to breed these miniature creatures in a responsible manner. Doing so, however, requires patience and planning. An ethical breeder would have to take a far more circuitous route than an unethical one would to develop, say, a line of blue Chihuahuas with long hair, because generations of outcrossing (mating to unrelated dogs) are needed to maintain the genetic integrity of the line and to compensate for the inevitable backcrossing to select for the desired trait. Unfortunately, the relentless pursuit of novel combinations of proportion, color, and coat leads some breeders to take the path of least resistance\u2014and gravest consequence to dogs. Litters produced after several generations of inbreeding usually yield predominantly stillborn or deformed puppies, among which one may be viable, albeit enervated by its weakened genome.</p><!--P8--><p>Sadly, with <a href=\"/animal/Yorkshire-terrier\">Yorkshire terriers</a> (a breed that, especially in teacup varieties, is a frequent victim of inbreeding) recently surpassing even <a href=\"/animal/golden-retriever\">golden retrievers</a> in popularity in the United States, breeders looking to exploit the expanding market for petite pets are well served to ignore the dictates of genetic ethics and persist in breeding for the bottom line. Without legislation regulating inbreeding, little stands in their way.</p><!--P9--><p><strong>Tempest over Teacups</strong></p><!--P10--><p>Some have argued that kennel clubs share responsibility for the breeding practices that lead to congenital disorders by virtue of the clubs\u2019 stress on the importance of type\u2014the specifications that breeds are expected to meet in the show arena\u2014over the health problems that might arise through persistent selection for extreme appearance. The American Kennel Club accepts the practice of <a href=\"/science/inbreeding\">inbreeding</a>\u2014indeed, considers it unavoidable\u2014though it advises that only experienced breeders attempt it.
